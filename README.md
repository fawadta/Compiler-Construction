# Compiler-Construction
Implementation of sub-modules of Compiler Construction 

## Insights
I'd gone through the practices and steps that are required for Compiler Construction. As Compiler Construction involves a series of steps so, here I went through those steps one by one. 
> It contains:
- Count numbers of chars
- Replace multiple spaces with single one
- Count numbers of single line comments
- Delete single line comments from file
- Store tokens in symbol table
- CFG in linked list
- Find numbers of terminals and non-terminals
- First and Follow set

> The steps that I didn't cover:
- Store the tokens in symbol table.
- Remove left recursion
- Remove left factoring
- LL(1) parser using stack
- Bottom-up parser

**Disclaimer**: Its scope was limited to the Compiler Construction course. Moreover, this code doesn't actually construct the compiler. As constructing a fully functional compiler also involves many other [steps](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phase-of-compiler.png).
